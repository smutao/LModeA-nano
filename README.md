# LModeA-nano

LModeA-nano can be used to quantify the chemical bond strength in various chemical systems including solids, surfaces and molecules, based on local vibrational mode theory. 

LModeA-nano is distributed as an open-source plugin to the PyMOL package. Detailed documentation can be found at https://lmodea-nano.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

The documentation and examples will be continuously updated. 

We welcome any feedback or suggestions to improve.
